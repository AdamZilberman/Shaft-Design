The code requires users to input a shaft length that is no shorter than the typical load length in the example wind turbine design.
Given shaft input length the first sections of the code will provide first iterative guess where the user will then need to provide additional information.
The user can provide additional information including but not limited to material properties, fillet radius and gear radius.

The code uses principles from DE theory and uses values from the tables in Shigley's. Our team decided to simulate 1040 CD Steel at 265 degrees farenheit.
The order of codes is input shaft, midshaft and output shaft. All these codes will provide a user with the deflection curves, moment diagrams, torque diagrams
and shear force diagrams. The final output shaft will also provide the user with resultant moment diagrams.







*These codes are modified versions from user lalo05alvarez.
